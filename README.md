- My interests include 20th and 21st century American politics, music, film, cooking, and exercise.
- I am currently playing through Elden Ring and Metroid Fusion.

- The two repositories I chose are this from [WikiTeam](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam) and this one from [MuseScore](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore).
